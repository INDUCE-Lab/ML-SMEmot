Machine Learning Event-based Social Media Emotion Detection Proactive Preparedness Framework Addressing Mental Health: A Novel Twitter Dataset, and Case Study of COVID-19 Vaccine in the United Arab Emirates

A novel Twitter dataset of over 11 Thousands COVID-19 vaccine-related-and-non-vaccine-related tweets.

We collect tweets posted between 29-01-2020 and 31-07-2022. We divide the duration into three periods:

1) 29-01-2020 – 14-09-2020, from the first case of COVID-19 in UAE until the vaccination announcement, 2) 14-09-2020 – 09-12-2020, from the announcement of vaccination until the commencement of the vaccination program, and 3) 09-12-2020 – 31-07-2022, which is from the commencement of the vaccination program till the time of writing the paper

The information related to the Tweets datase is represented in the following two files:

1. **UAE-COVID-19-Vaccine-Related-Tweets** which includes all the tweets COVID-19-vaccine-related in UAE 
2. **UAE-COVID-19-Vaccine-Related-Tweets_Annotated** which includes all the tweets COVID-19-vaccine-related in UAE annotated with **TextBlob**, **VADER**, **Canadian Emotion**, and the **final annotation** which constitute of the **three sentiments (negative, positive, and neutral),** and **Plutchik’s eight emotions (joy, fear, anger, anticipation, sadness, surprise, disgust, and trust)**.

We comply with Twitter’s Terms of Service by anonymizing the datasets which constitute tweet IDs.  

## Abstract



## About this work
This work proposes a novel Machine-Learning event-based framework to detect people emotions on Social Media. Unlike related work in the literature which focus on polarity emotions (negative, positive, and neutral), this paper detects Plutchik’s eight emotions (joy, fear, anger, anticipation, sadness, surprise, disgust, and trust), in addition to polarity emotions.

We create a novel twitter dataset annotated with emotions.  This dataset is a vehicle for research on Social Media Emotion Detection.
